 <p> I am an optimistic, ambitious, and discipline 20 years old. I love art and reggae music. 
     I strive for the best and I am competitive therefore, I believe a career in computing is the right fit. 
     My major is Computer Science and hopefully, I will minor in Economics.  
     I believe 'coders' change the world, therefore learning Web development is a huge booster. 
     Additionally, there is a lot of opportunities to freelance.</p>
